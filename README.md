## This Project follows best coding practices!

    Proper Naming Convention: Are variable names descriptive? Do method names accurately describe their function? Are there any typos in the codebase?
    Magic Numbers: Are there any hard-coded values that should be replaced with named constants or variables?
    Single Responsibility Principle: Do classes, functions, and methods follow the single responsibility principle?
    Redundant or Duplicate Code: Is there any redundant or duplicate code? (CPD can be used to detect this)
    Commented Code: Is commented code present and does it accurately describe the intent and function of the code?
    Code Modularity: Is the code modular and easy to understand?
    Overuse of Options: Are options being overused?
    Nested Pattern Matching: Can nested pattern matching be converted into for comprehensions to make the code more readable?
    Related Data Structures: Do data structures contain only related data?
    Appropriate Method Arguments: Do method arguments have simple and appropriate names and types?
    Function Length: Do functions in the codebase confirm to the length (more than 50 lines of code)?
    Default Arguments: Are default arguments being used instead of hardcoded values?
    Tuples: Are tuples being used judiciously, or would a case class be more appropriate?

  ## What it does? and How it Works?
  
This code implements a function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

The function nthFibonacciNumber takes a single parameter position which represents the position of the Fibonacci number to calculate, starting from 0.

The function returns a Try[Int] which is a Scala Try monad that wraps the calculated Fibonacci number, or a failure with an error message if the position is negative.

The function first checks if the position is negative, and if so, it returns a Failure wrapped in an IllegalArgumentException with an error message that the position must be non-negative.

If the position is non-negative, the function then calculates the Fibonacci number using a tail-recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence.

The fibonacci function is defined within the nthFibonacciNumber function and takes three parameters: currentPosition, previousNumber, and currentNumber.

currentPosition is the current position being calculated, previousNumber is the number at the position immediately before the current position, and currentNumber is the number at the current position.

The fibonacci function is defined using pattern matching, which is a feature of the Scala language that allows you to match values against patterns and execute code based on the match.

The fibonacci function checks the value of currentPosition to determine the appropriate case to execute.

The base cases are when the current position is 0 or 1. If the current position is 0, then the function returns the previousNumber. If the current position is 1, then the function returns the currentNumber.

The recursive case is when the current position is greater than 1. In this case, the function calls itself recursively with the new currentPosition being the previous position minus 1, the previousNumber being the current number, and the currentNumber being the sum of the previous number and the current number.

Finally, the function returns the calculated Fibonacci number wrapped in a Success monad.
